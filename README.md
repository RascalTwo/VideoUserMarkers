## How It's Made

**Tech Used:** JavaScript, HTML, Tailwind CSS, EJS, React, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Mongoose, YouTube API, Twitch API

Using both YouTube and Twitch APIs to collect entity information, and allowing users to manage their collection of timestamps for videos, this application allows users to add timestamps to videos, or view those of others.

## Optimizations

Improvement of both the Search functionality and the support of Playlists is planned.

## Lessons Learned

Much was learned about using OpenCV template matching, efficiently using the YouTube API, and writing reusable code for both a GUI and CLI interface.
